# Project Title

This repo is to keep work relating to our Stat 184 Group Final Project organized.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to show the relation between the cost of producing gasoline and the consumer cost of gasoline, while also seeing how major events effected these metrics. We also will work on improving our skills relating to graphics creation.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

Our data is coming from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics Series reports. I do not have the link at the time of writing this but it will be added.

## Current Plan

Create comparison visuals between the cost of producing gasoline and the consumer cost of gasoline, as well as adding dates of significant economical events.

## Repo Structure

Branches will be used to organize different elements of code such as data wrangling, cleaning, and visual creation.
